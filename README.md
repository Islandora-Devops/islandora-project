This is a Composer-based installer for the [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/documentation) Drupal distribution.

This project is used by the official installers that set up a virtual machine and deploy the full Islandora stack.

This project does not include a particular install profile. It is expected that you do a composer require to add the profile you want to install.
